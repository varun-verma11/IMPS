**char (instruction[][]) {
  /*
  This should return an array of strings, splitting up the instructions into
  tokens. Tokens should cover labels (the first piece of text ending in a 
  colon ":"), operations (such as add, addi, mul, muli, etc) and operands (such
  as the registers where data is found and stored or the immediate values to be
  used). 
  
  issue: Should I further split them into operand types, ie explicitly state if 
  it's a register, constant or address?)
