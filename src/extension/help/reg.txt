reg -r:

  reg -r <R1> <Rn>

  The display is inclusive of the extreme bounds of the range. 
  eg. To display the contents of registers 0 to 7 enter the following command:
  
  reg -r $0 $7
  
reg -m:

  reg -m <R1> <R2> ... <Rn>

  eg. To display the contents of registers 1, 3 and 7 enter the following 
  command:

  reg -m $1 $3 $7
